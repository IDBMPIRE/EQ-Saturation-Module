# EQ Saturation Module
In the files above I have included the Max MSP file for my software emulation and photo documentation of my hardware device.

This software is based on a hardware unit I am currently developing, The software version is in its most basic form as also still in development stages.

The overall goal is to take audio signal and apply the process of saturation, An Equilizer has been implemented in order to sculp the signal going into the saturation/distortion process.

The hardware unit incorperates a preamp, Shelving EQ, saturation module (overdrive) and a vactrol style compression module (still in development) and a final output amplification stage.
This is all run from low voltage power supply (9-15v), as you will see three of five modules have been created (Preamp,EQ & Overdrive), Vactrol compression element is still in development stages on breadboard and the final amplification stage is yet to be built as it is just a duplication of the first initial preamplification module.

Also included are the hardware schematics of all the elements utilised for the hardware unit.
