# EQ Saturation Module
In the files above I have included the Max MSP file for my software emulation.

This software is based on a hardware unit I am currently developing, The software version is in its most basic form as also still in development stages.

The overall goal is to take audio signal and apply the process of saturation, An Equilizer has been implemented in order to sculp the signal going into the saturation/distortion process.
